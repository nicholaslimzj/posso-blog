In today's world, the burden on children is increasing all the time. From academics to extracurricular activities, children are regularly subjected to constant pressure to excel in all areas. Only parents can put an end to this.

Kids should be given ample opportunities to enjoy their childhood. All they need is support and someone who understands or listens to them.

Here are some ways you can do to support your childâ€™s mental wellbeing;

### 1\. Build trust

Your relationship with your children has a significant impact on their mental health, and a strong relationship begins with trust. Creating a sense of safety and security is one way to build trust.

This includes taking care of your child's physical and emotional needs, such as when they are hungry, thirsty, hot, and cold, as well as when they are scared, anxious, or sad.

And, of course, do what you say and say what you mean. Your children rely on you to be consistent, truthful, and caring. Find ways to show them that you care about them and that they can rely on you to keep them safe and healthy.

### 2\. Creating a positive home environment

There is nothing like home, and a child's maximum mental growth depends on how their home environment is. As a result, as a parent, you should make sure that the atmosphere at home is lively, positive, and a safe haven for your children.

Showing a child a lot of love and appreciation, as well as praising them for their small accomplishments, can go a long way toward bringing peace to their mind.

### 3\. Teach stress management

While it is important to protect your child from trauma such as abuse and bullying, you cannot keep your child from experiencing stress. Stress is a normal part of life and teaching your child how to deal with it in a healthy way now will set him or her up for future success.

For example, they are bound to have disagreements with friends at some point in their lives. Give your children the skills they need to deal with those situations right away in order to build their mental strength.

### 4\. Discipline without labelling

Avoid using words like lazy, naughty, or stupid when disciplining your child because these phrases do not reinforce what acceptable behaviour is.

Instead, correct your child's inappropriate behaviour by explaining why it was inappropriate.

Telling them you love them but disagree with their behavior can make them more mindful of their actions.

### 5\. Have realistic expectations

Avoid making comparisons and don't make them feel like a failure when they do not perform well. This will lower their morale and self-esteem, making them less eager to learn and less motivated to give their best.

Instead, praise them for their efforts and work with them to improve their performance gradually.

Always remember that in this battle of mental health never leave your child alone. Making these small changes will help your child blossom into a completely different human being. All the best, parents!
